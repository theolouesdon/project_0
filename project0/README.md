My website is an introduction to Tennis with 4 different .html pages and many css and scss features. There is a use of boostrap's coloms and rows throughout the whole website (all 4 html pages)
    -In the file named index.html you have the magor framework with all links to the other pages. Furthermore, there is a table and a button. There also is another boostrap feature that is the succes alert message even if it isn't used as an alert message. It is the core page leading to all other pages.
    -In the file named court.html there are the different types of corts. The @media query is used to put images full screen size when shown on a small sized screen. There is also the use of an unordered list.
    -In the file named points.html there is some text explain the Tennis point system and an image that alos shrinks when the screen gets smaller.
    -In the file named tournaments.html there is an unordered list to list all the grand slams of tennis. There is also the use of flexbox, creating boxes with content and their placement varies depending on the screen size.
